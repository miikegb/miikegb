## Hi there 👋. Thanks for stopping by...

### 👨🏽‍💻 About Me

I'm Miguel, a Mobile Developer passionate for clean code. I know this sounds like I'm just saying it because it's what all software engineers have to say, but in reality I truly care about good looking code. That's not to say, I always write clean code, but I do my best and try to help others understand the importance of doing so.

I have been an iOS Developer for over a decade now (wow!, it's crazy to even ~~say~~write it, but time only moves in one direction). During all that time I have learned quite a few things along the way.
